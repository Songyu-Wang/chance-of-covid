# What are the chance of encountering people with COVID if I go out today?
I do not know, but I would like to know

## Basic idea
Calculate the percentage of people may have COVID today in state population

### How can I find out how many people may have COVID today?
Please note this is an over simplified educated guess. Do not over interpret the result 
1. Using API https://covidtracking.com/ to get new case increase counts for the last 14 days for each state
2. Find the maximum increase count in the past 14 days
3. `Max value * 14 * 2` (This is by no means accurate. Too many factors are involved. I hope this is a conservative educated guess by using max value and `* 2` as fault tolerance mitigators ) 

### How can I find out population in each state?
